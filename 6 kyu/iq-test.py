# Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one of the given numbers differs from the others.
# Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in evenness.
# Help Bob â€” to check his answers, he needs a program that among the given numbers finds one that is different in evenness, and return a position of this number.

# Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test, which means indexes of the elements start from 1 (not 0)
